# World_Weather_Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to collect and present data for customers via search, where they can filter information based on their preferences for travel. We created a vacation map by utilizing Google API's to provide routes and hotels for recommendations. 

### Reuslts
We were able to generate a list of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes in order to create the vacaction map. Using Python's citipy module we were able to identify the nearest cities for each coordinate pair and using OpenWeatherMap API, we were able to retreive the specified weather for each location.
